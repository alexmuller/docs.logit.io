## Stacks

A stack is an instance of logstash, elastic search and kibana working together. When you sign up to logit we automatically provision you a brand new stack
but you can have as many stacks as you like. 

Stacks are great for separating different environments like test, staging and production or just as useful
for separating different teams who are working on different projects. 

Stacks can have different data and retention requirements making them fit perfectly
for any situation. If you need to provision another stack or change existing ones please contact support.
