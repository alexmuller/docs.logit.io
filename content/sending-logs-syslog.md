A syslog endpoint has been created for you in your logstash input config.

Click the configuration link on the stack you wish to log too in your [dashboard] (https://logit.io/Dashboard).

Your logstash endpoint link and input configuration input is written out for you. Note you can send syslog over udp or tcp.
